# Recipe Manager

An Android single-Activity app for securely managing your personal recipes, ingredients and daily meal plans entirely on your device. No external database sync—everything is stored locally using Room—and you get a gentle daily reminder of what's on your meal plan.

## Features

* **Email/Password Authentication**

  • Add, edit and delete recipes with title, category, difficulty, servings and ingredient list  
  • Full-screen detail view showing all ingredients and instructions  
  • Mark recipes as "favorites" for quick access

  Receive a "Today's Meal Plan" notification every morning at 8 AM for any meals you've scheduled  
* **Offline-First Storage**  
  All data (recipes, ingredients, meal plans) lives in a local Room database—no network needed to browse or edit  
* **Smooth Navigation & Animations**  
  • Single-Activity architecture with Navigation Component + BottomNavigationView  
  • Slide-in/slide-out fragment transitions defined in `res/anim/`  
  • Type-safe SafeArgs for passing `recipeId` between fragments  

## Tech Stack

* **Kotlin**  
* **AndroidX Navigation** + BottomNavigationView

## 📋 What You Need

* **Android Studio 2022.3+**
* **Android SDK**: API Level 24+ (minSdkVersion 24), compileSdk 34
* **An Android device or emulator** running Android 6.0 ("Marshmallow") or higher
* **Firebase Project**: 
  1. Create a Firebase project in the console 
  2. Enable **Email/Password** sign-in under Authentication 
  3. Download and drop your `google-services.json` into `app/`
* **Internet connection** for initial authentication (after login, all data is local)
* **(Android 13+) Notification permission**: 
  The app will prompt you to grant `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` so you can receive your daily meal reminders.

## How to Run

1. **Clone** the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lukatc/Recipe-Manager.git
   ```

2. **Import** in Android Studio
3. **Add** your Firebase config: copy `google-services.json` into the `app/` folder
4. **Sync** Gradle and build
5. **Run** on a device or emulator (Android 6.0+)
6. **Grant** notification permission when prompted (Android 13+) so daily reminders can appear

## Terms of Use

* All recipe and meal-plan data is stored **locally** on your device.
* Firebase is used **only** for user authentication; no recipe data is uploaded or shared.

## How the App Works

### Main Flow

1. **Launch** → `MainActivity` checks FirebaseAuth:

   * If user is signed in → show **Recipes**
   * Otherwise → navigate to **Login**
2. **BottomNavigationView** switches between:

   * **Recipes** (list, search, favorites)
   * **Meal Plan** (add/remove planned meals)
   * **Profile** (view email, log out)
3. **Add/Edit** uses a form fragment to collect title, ingredients, category, difficulty and servings
4. **Detail** screens load recipe + ingredients from Room by `recipeId` via SafeArgs
5. **MealPlanReminderWorker** runs daily at 8 AM (WorkManager) and posts a notification if any meals are scheduled
